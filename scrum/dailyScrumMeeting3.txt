Nov 3, 2017
	Yesterday : Color is still buggy but  
	Today     : Fix color, not updating correctly.
	Obstacles : For loop draws the scribbles over and over, so redrawing causes every moment causes problems.

Nov 4, 2017
	Yesterday : fixed the problem where the old color carried on to the next scribble for some of that scribble.
	Today     : Start the work for polyline with mateen.

Nov 11, 2017
	Yesterday : Break.
	Today     : Working on user story 19. Zooming in and out. (Userstory 19 was renamed later.)
	Obstacles : Zooming could be completed. Attempt (1) used scale method which zoomed in to the top left corner. Instead of location of mouse
				Attempt (2) Tried to redraw the shapes bigger or smaller depending on the amount scrolled in or out.
				This did not work because some shape could not be drawn to scale easily. A method is given in swing to draw shapes to a specific 
				scale but that did not work because out shapes have their own class unrelated to the shape class used in swing.
	
Nov 12, 2017
	Yesterday : Stopped working on UserStory19 Zooming in and out.
	Today     : Working on user story 19. (Currently named Copy and Paste.)
	Obstacles : Copying the shapes was not possible. Any attempt at copying created a pointer to the original shape. Full copies could not be created
				because all attributes of said shape can not be obtained from an abstract shape.
	
Nov 13, 2017
	Yesterday : Started working on select and move 
	Today     : Finish UserStory 19.1, UserStory 19.2 and 19.3
	Obstacles : Entire design pattern was changed, I had to re write the code for userstory 19 to fit the design pattern.
				This took a very long time.
			  *Note that the late commit of User Story 19 was caused by the change of it's purpose two times.
Nov 14, 2017
	Yesterday : Finished UserStory 19.1, 19.2, 19.3
	Today     : Still adjusting code due to change in design pattern. Once finished do Bug 14. 
	Obstacles : None. Bug 14 is a small fix.
